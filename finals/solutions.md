# Team 17 Solutions for C2C CTF Finals

These are writeups to problems that my team members and I were able to solve in the C2C CTF finals. We ended up placing 3rd in the entire competition, narrowly trailing 1st and 2nd place who got the same number of solves as us but did so in a faster time period. This competition has definitely taught me a lot about working in a team and also learning to perservere through hard problems. I'm excited with how well we did this year and I'm very much looking forward to being a part of C2C CTF again next year, where MIT will be the hosting university!
